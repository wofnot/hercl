------ MAKING ------

On the most part, making is a reasonably simple process:

  To make hercsearch or hercl:
  make -C src/base hercsearch

  To make an interactive environment called 'example_env':
  make -C inter/evol example_env
  
  To make the environment in debug mode:
  make -C debug example_env
  
Unfortunately, making executables that require openCV libs (i.e. runMetrics and art-school), the process is a little different. You have to have cmake installed as well. Sorry.

  Before running any of these you have to configure cmake (you need only do this once ever):
  cd cmake; cmake .; cd ..

  To make art-school:
  make -C cmake art-school
  
  To make art-school in debug mode:
  make -C cmake debug_art-school
  
  To make runMetrics:
  make -C cmake runMetrics
